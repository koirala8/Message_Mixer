# Message_Mixer
The project extracts and isolates its encryption functions into a module, called encryptors.js, and then refactor message-mixer.js to use this moduleâ€™s functions.

# Message Mixer Encryption Module

Message Mixer Inc. offers a message-encryption service that transforms input text using various ciphers and displays the encrypted message to the console. This project extracts and isolates the encryption functions into a module called `encryptors.js`, allowing other developers to import these encryption functions into their own projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd message-mixer-encryption
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To use this encryption service, run the following command:

```bash
node message-mixer.js ['caesar'|'symbol'|'reverse'] [amount]
```

Examples:

```bash
# Caesar Cipher
node message-mixer.js caesar 4

# Symbol Cipher
node message-mixer.js symbol

# Reverse Cipher
node message-mixer.js reverse
```

## Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `message-mixer.js`: Main script handling user input and displaying encrypted messages.
- `encryptors.js`: Module containing encryption functions (`caesarCipher`, `symbolCipher`, `reverseCipher`).
- `shoppingList.txt`: Sample text file for demonstration purposes.
